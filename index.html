            Country Manager for retail and distribution. This has given me special
            insight into business, and i use my analytical thinking to develop an
            understanding of the market, identify trends, and predict consumer
            habits. My management style allows me to build effective teams, launch
            successful sales programs, and partner with clients at all levels of
            authority.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have repeated success guiding cross-functional teams with hands-on
            leadership to promote brands, enhance product awareness and develop a
            loyal and profitable account base. Talent for launching sales programs

            partners and build consensus across multiple organizational levels.
            Proficient in Microsoft Word, Excel, Oracle, Business Object,SAP and

          </p>
          <p>
            I have recently added some coding experience including VBA, Python and
            Web / Software Development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have established a reputation as a
            transformational leader who is driven by challenge, undeterred by
            obstacles, and committed to furthering standards of excellence. My
            expertise encompasses all aspects of business and sales development,
            from controlling costs and maximizing revenues to harnessing team
            strengths to improve companywide performance. Further, my ability to

            transparency and influence positive change has been repeatedly proven.
          </p>
          <p>Please consider the following highlights of my qualifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              As an experienced leader and director of operations and sales, I am
              able to develop realistic budget to provide teams with the resources
              and funding necessary to achieve success. I am an effective leader

            <br />
            <li>
              My proven history of managing inventory has given me a special
              insight into what it takes to increase sales and penetrate markets.
              I have worked with high-profile brands like Hershey’s and Budweiser
              and partnered to distribute these products in competitive markets.
              This requires having knowledge of the market and consumer demands,
              being able to set appropriate prices and maintaining the volume
              necessary to meet customer needs.

          <h3>Accounting & Finance</h3>
          <p>Starting my career in the <strong>accounting</strong> field gave me a very solid understading of how all accounting modules such as the A/P, A/R, Assets and G/L are connected starting with the Trial Balance Sheet all the way to the final <em>Financial Statements</em>.</p>
          <p>As a result, i was able to aquire the following skills:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Analytical thinking.</li>
            <li>Attention to details.</li>
            <li>Organization.</li>
            <li>Process improvments.</li>

          <h3>Sales & Marketing</h3>
          <p>After spending years in the accounting & finance field, i transitioned to the sales and marketing field where i was promoted to be the Country manager and the youngest executive in one of the largest FMCG distribution companies in the Middle East.</p>
          <p>I was instantly able to integrate my previous financial experience with what i was learning day after day, but was able to improve processes by making it more efficient and cost effective.</p>
          <p>One of my biggest <strong>achievements</strong> was to fully redesign the <em>RTM</em> process by creatng a system that links all different departments:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Create a stream of income to be allocated to the newly created A&P budget by doing the following:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Converting all branches to seperate SBUs facilitating the process of micor and macro management</li>
                <li>Categorizing each SBU based on revenue generated (80/20)</li>
                <li>Allocate 3% of total sales to the A&P budget based on category assigned</li>
                <li>Realocate the A&P budget strategically to each SBU based on current period promotions and <span class="category-conversion">CATEGORY CONVERSION</span></li>
              </ul>
            <li>Starting with analyzing sales historical data, i was able to identify and quantifying growth opportunities.</li>
            <li>Justifying growth opportuinies by:
              <ul>
                <li>CPG (ACV) analysis, Promo grids (Trade and consumer promotions), loyalty programs, distribution footprints, new markets penetrations, incentive plans, optimizing <em>MSL</em> and merchandising strategies, Cross selling, strategically injecting new SKUs and brands.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>Coordinating with the supply chain department to link the newly adjusted sales forcast to the ordering system, this prevents any lost opportunity sales due to OOS or over stock that will result in increase in spoilage.</li>
            <li>Managing the WMS to allocate lots based on CBF and FIFO to ensure proper product rotation.</li>
            <li>Coordinating with the logostics department to ensure proper product allocation to the SBUs based on the newly adjusted sales forcast by period.</li>
            <li>Coordinating with the sales department to ensure the proper RTM.</li>
            <li>Ensuring that all planned promotions are well prepared for 6 weeks ahead of execution and the product to be available and reserved in the allocated warehouses 3 weeks ahead of promotion dates.</li>
            <li>Measure the success rate based on the following metrics:
              <ul>
                <li>Customer acquisition cost.</li>
                <li>Conversion rate.</li>
                <li>ROI.</li>
                <li>Credibility.</li>

                <li>Product life cycle.</li>
              </ul>

          <h3>Team Leadership</h3>
          <p>Throughout my career, i faced lots of chalenges trying to build my experience. Facing difficulties in learning the business from other colleagues as everybody tends to keep their information to themselves, also chalenges to coop with the corporate politics where top management cared less about hard working mid level employees and seeing them as replaceble <em>tools</em> not as assets.</p>
          <p>So i decided to be selftaugh and take notes of every piece of information i can get my hands on to do my own research and build on it. This gave me the chance to improve my know-how skill and learn from available resources.</p>
          <p>It also taught me how not to be the manager that i should not be but be the manager that leads by example as well as the following skills:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lead by example and never say "Do what i say and dont do what i do".</li>
            <li>To lead by example, i learned to be <em>hands on</em>.</li>
            <li>Never treat my employees the same way i was treated, but learn from it and be a better manager than my previous own managers.</li>
            <li>Treat my employees as assets when needed and to help them stand out from the crowd.</li>
            <li>Reaslizing that the good employee is the one that gets the job done, but the assest employee is the one that gets the job done with a lot of added value to it.</li>
            <li>Realizing that there is a thin thread between being taugh and being soft, and thats by being fair.</li>
            <li>By splitting branches into SBUs, i was able to hold SBU heads accountable to their team's performance, by showing top performers and acknowledging them, i was able to create a friendly competitve enviroment.</li>
            <li>Give my emplyees the easy way of learning new skills and improve their knowledge not letting them learn the hard way i learned.</li>
            <li>Be part of solving their problems and try to support them by giving them the right advise.</li>
            <li>Say what they need to hear not what the want to hear.</li>
            <li>Introducing more team bonding activities.</li>
